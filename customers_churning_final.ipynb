    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Senior Leading Team wants to find out why our customers are churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of questions they would like answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are there clear groupings where a customer is more likely to churn? What if you consider contract type? Is there a tenure that month-to-month customers are most likely to churn? 1-year contract customers? 2-year customers? Do you have any thoughts on what could be going on? (Be sure to state these thoughts not as facts but as untested hypotheses. Unless you test them!). Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers).\n",
    "2. Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of Internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?\n",
    "3. Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?\n",
    "4. If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this project are to answer the above questions and to deliver our findings in the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Report with detailed analysis in .ipynb format\n",
    "2. CSV file containing customer_id, probability of churn, and the prediction of churn (1=churn, 0=not_churn)\n",
    "3. Google Slides explaining model chosen and brief analysis for SLT\n",
    "4. All files necessary to recreate our findings and models\n",
    "5. Readme file\n",
    "6. GitHub repo containing all files"
